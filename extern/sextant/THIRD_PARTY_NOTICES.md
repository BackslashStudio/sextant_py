# Third-party notices

sextant itself is MIT licensed (see [LICENSE](LICENSE)). It vendors, fetches or
links the components below. All of them are permissive; none imposes a copyleft
obligation on your use of sextant. This file exists because several of them ask
that their notice travel with the software, and because FreeType asks to be
credited in documentation.

If you ship a binary that embeds sextant, ship this file with it.
