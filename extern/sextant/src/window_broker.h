    // swap, and GL itself) is free to live anywhere. So those two halves are
    // split: the broker owns the first, the render thread keeps the second.
    //
    // On Windows and Linux the broker does its work inline on the calling thread
    // and the pump is each window thread's own, exactly as before; the split is
    // still there, so the same code path is the one that runs everywhere.
